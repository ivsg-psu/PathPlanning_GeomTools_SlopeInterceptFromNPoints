function [slope,intercept] = fcn_geometry_find_slope_intercept_from_N_points(points,varargin)
% fcn_geometry_find_slope_intercept_from_N_points
% Finds the slope and intercept of a line connecting two points
% Format: 
% [slope,intercept] = fcn_geometry_find_slope_intercept_from_N_points(points)
%
% INPUTS:
%      points: a Nx2 vector where N is the number of points, but at least 2. 
%
% OUTPUTS:
%      slope: a scalar (1x1) representing the slope connecting the two
%      points
%      intercept: a scalar (1x1) representing the y-axis intercept of the
%      line fit
%
% Examples:
%      
%      % BASIC example
%      points = [2 3; 4 5];
%      [slope,intercept] = fcn_geometry_find_slope_intercept_from_N_points(points)
% 
% See the script: script_test_fcn_geometry_find_slope_intercept_from_N_points

% The code below sets up the problem as a regression form. Since the
% equation of a line is:
%     y = m*x + b
% then:
%     y1 = m*x1 + b
%     y2 = m*x2 + b
%     (etc)
% or:
%     Y = m*X+b
% or:
%     Y = [X 1]*[m b]';
% which allows one to solve for [m b] via matrix multiplication via
%
%    result = ([X 1]'*[X 1])\([X 1]*Y)
%
% where result = [m b]
%
